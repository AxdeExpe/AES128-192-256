# AES128-192-256: Educational Implementation

This repository contains an **educational implementation of AES encryption** with key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits. It is intended **solely for personal learning, experimentation, and practice** with cryptographic algorithms.

> ⚠️ Note: This repository is for **educational purposes only**. It is **not an official solution**, and it should **not be used in production** or distributed as course material.

## Contents

- **Implementation**: AES encryption in C, including 10, 12, and 14 rounds for the respective key lengths.
- **Tests**: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.
- **Build System**: CMake configuration for building the project.
